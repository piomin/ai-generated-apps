The `sample-spring-boot-web-with-db` app was generated by the Claude Code Assistant with the following prompt:
```text
Generate a sample Spring Boot application in the latest stable version you know with a REST API that connects to a PostgreSQL database. 
Don't ask about anything, just generate. 
The Maven project name should be sample-spring-boot-web-with-db and it should be generated in the sample-spring-boot-web-with-db directory.

The application should have the following features: 
- A Person entity with id, and typical fields related to each person 
- Should implement the Spring Data Repository pattern 
- Should implement CRUD operations for the Person entity 
- Should use Springdoc OpenAPI to document the REST API
- Should protect all rest endpoints with JWT and OAuth2 
- Should use Skaffold and Jib for deployment on Kubernetes 
- Should contain all the deployment files for Kubernetes 
- Should implement tests with Testcontainers to verify all exposed endpoints 
- Should have CircleCI pipeline to build, run tests, and test deployment to Kubernetes (on Kind) with Skaffold
- Database schema should be managed with Liquibase. Tests must finish successfully.

The application should use the following technologies: 
- Spring Boot 4 
- Spring Data JPA 
- Maven 
- Springdoc OpenAPI 
- Java 25
```

The `sample-microservice` app was generated by the Claude Code Assistant with the following prompt:
```text
Generate a system that allows users to search, reserve and pay for taxi trips. It can be a single application or a microservice architecture.

A list of business requirements for the system:
- Each user must be registered and a system must store his card details to process payments.
- Each driver must be registered with his car.
- All active drivers must share their current location.
- User shares his location and pick a target destination for the taxi fare.
- System calculates the cost and return it to the user. The cost depends on the location, time, and distance traveled. Generate some sample values.
- Each user can evaluate the driver and share his opinions.
- System must send a summary of the trip with the amount sent to the user by email.
- System must store trips history.
- System must calculate and show reviews summary for each driver.

A list of technical requirements for the system:
- Generate only backend services, don't do anything with frontend.
- The codebase should be generated in the `sample-spring-microservices` directory.
- Use Java and Spring Boot.
- Use PostgreSQL to store required data.
- The database integration should be implemented with Spring Data JPA and repository pattern. 
- Prefer asynchronous communication with a message broker (Kafka) if possible.
- System must expose several REST endpoints to allow external client like mobile or frontend app to interact with the system. 
- Implement tests with Testcontainers to verify all exposed endpoints. 
- Protect all rest endpoints with JWT and OAuth2.
```
